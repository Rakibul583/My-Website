                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p><b>"Customer Service"</b>
                        I created a fully functional and interactive pizza order form for a fictional "Pizza Parlor"
                        using HTML and CSS. The form is designed to guide users through a step-by-step process to place
                        their orders seamlessly. It includes sections for entering customer information such as name,
                        address, and phone number, selecting the pizza size using radio buttons, and choosing multiple
                        toppings through checkboxes. The layout is clean and organized using fieldsets and legends,
                        ensuring a user-friendly experience. Action buttons for submitting the order and resetting the
                        form provide added convenience. The CSS styling enhances the design, making the form visually
                        appealing and responsive across various devices. This project demonstrates my ability to build
                        intuitive and well-structured web forms that focus on functionality and design.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p><b>"Form fill up"</b> I developed a fully responsive form fill-up application using HTML and CSS,
                        designed for
                        efficient and user-friendly data collection. The form includes various input fields such as
                        text, email, passwords, dropdown menus, checkboxes, and radio buttons, all complemented by
                        real-time client-side validation to ensure accuracy and enhance user experience. The layout is
                        styled with CSS to deliver a visually appealing interface that adapts seamlessly across devices,
                        ensuring accessibility on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This project highlights my ability
                        to create functional and aesthetically pleasing front-end solutions while adhering to modern web
                        development standards.</p>

                    <p>
                        <b>"Air Quality Prediction: A Comparative Study of ARIMA and SARIMA Models"</b> explores
                        forecasting
                        air quality using time series models. The project involves analyzing historical pollution data,
                        identifying trends and seasonality, and implementing ARIMA and SARIMA models. Their performance
                        is evaluated using metrics like MAE and RMSE to determine their effectiveness. The study
                        provides insights into the strengths and limitations of both models, offering guidance for
                        selecting the best approach for air quality forecasting, with potential applications in
                        environmental management and policy-making.
